	Create different shapes that can be part of a sortable list. The sort order is based on the size of their respective areas:
	The area of a Square is the square of its side
	The area of a Triangle is base multiplied by height divided by 2
	The area of a Circle is the square of its radius multiplied by π

	Use the correct π constant for your circle area calculations:
	Math.PI

		double side = 7.1234;
		double radius = 1.1234;
		double base = 5;
		double height = 2;

		ArrayList<Shape> shapes = new ArrayList<Shape>();
		shapes.add(new Square(side));
		shapes.add(new Circle(radius));
		shapes.add(new Triangle(base, height));

		Collections.sort(shapes);
		
		
		for(Shape s:shapes) {
			System.out.println(s);
		}
		
		---expected result----
		Square 28.4936
		Triangle 5.0
		Circle 3.5292651870427734
